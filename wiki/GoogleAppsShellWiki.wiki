= Details =

Google Apps Shell makes it simple to programmatically issue commands to your Google Apps account.  It allows users to programmatically execute commands from the open source project [https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-manager Google Apps Manager] without having to write a bash script.  Some use cases include:
  * Changing every user's signature to a custom signature including their email address.
  * Moving every user from one domain to another, then removing the old user alias.
  * Creating resource calendars from a CSV file containing calendar resource information.
  * ...and any other interesting combination of GAM commands.
